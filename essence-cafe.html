        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> Essence was not the founder of coffee, oh no. We are, however, the makers of great coffee.
        <br>
        The vision for Essence was to create a nurturing place where people feel at home. The relaxed ambiance partnered with comfort, good food and drinks creates the perfect environment to relax on a date, business meeting or casual meal with the family.
        <br>
        Essence is a place that tastes and fells like home with a touch of rustic creativity and contemporary trends. Our food, culture and setup all create a place of comfort, warmth and laughter where good food and drinks can be enjoyed.
        <br>
        Essence Pietermaritzburg moved premises in 2014 to a larger store in the centre, The Square. The new premises with the double volume ceilings and rustic red face brick were perfectly suited for the homely, yet trendy, ambiance that Essence is known for. On Mondays to Fridays a Harvest table is laid to be enjoyed between 12h00 and 14h30. The table is filled with delicious pastas and curries, unique vegetable dishes and fresh salads. Customers can help themselves and price is worked out according to the weight on the plate. Our vast menu contains breakfasts and light lunches. Our hungrier customers can feast on our selection of gourmet burgers or steak options.
        <br>
        In 2017 Essence expanded into Hillcrest opening a store in Hillcrest Corner. Come sit with a cup of coffee and take in our unique antique collection that will throw back your memories to days gone by.
        <br>
        At both stores we are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our vast menu offers something for everyone – whether it be healthy salads or a hearty steak. Don’t forget to try our famous Chocolate Brownies! Once you taste one you will most certainly be back for more.</p>
