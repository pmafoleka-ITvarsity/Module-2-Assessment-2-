        <h1>ABOUT SORBET</h1>
        <p>Sorbet is your nationwide beauty therapy hub with over 200 Stores countrywide. From manicures to pedicures, skin care and body massages, good hair days and bad hair days (and unwanted hair days) we’re here to serve up a double scoop of “Amazing” all week long.
        <br>
        When you’re passionate about something, you know it. How? Because it draws you in. It ignites “something” inside of you and it tickles your bones with excitement.
        <br>
        So, when you’re passionate about service, you know it. You breathe it. You live it, because you live to improve the lives of others. “Service”, is the spine of our business. This is what we are built on, and around. Our service is what keeps us walking tall and standing proud.
        <br>
        We serve differently. We serve with heart. And it’s the heart of our business that sets us apart. We love what we do and we love who we are: world-class beauty professionals that care. We don’t have customers. We have guests. We don’t work to make money, we work to make friends. Best friends forever.
        <br>
        We are not a team. We are family. Sorbet is not just a brand. It’s an attitude. It’s “that” feeling. We’re all about hot towels, hot wax, Manicures and Manlicures, Blowouts and Bro-Outs, Hollywood, Brazilian, Swedish and Gelish. We paint and we dip we deep cleanse and we deep tissue. We do not deep sleep, we leave that for the day spas.
        <br>
        We don’t do boring. We’re all about energy and synergy. And paying that feeling of fabulous forward.</p>
